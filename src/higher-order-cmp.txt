why we need higher order components?


in our both counter functionalities we could reuse the counter functionalities but we instead duplicated it, which is not right way of react components.

so if 10 or more components need to use this functionalities. then we have to duplicate it

so immediate thought is to lift it up, but suppose the components are scattered, then its big issue, 

here we use HOC

why we need HOC : To share common functionalities between components

what is HOC : is a pattern which takes a component and returns the other component.

const NewComponent = HigherOrderComponent(OriginalComponent)

enhanced component 



--------------------------

now we tried to pass the Props from the HOC to the other Components.
