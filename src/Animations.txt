React Transition Group
React Transition Group library is a simple implementation of animation. It does not do any animation out of the box. Instead, it exposes the core animation related information. Every animation is basically transition of an element from one state to another. The library exposes minimum possible state of every element and they are given below −

Entering
Entered
Exiting
Exited
The library provides options to set CSS style for each state and animate the element based on the style when the element moves from one state to another. The library provides in props to set the current state of the element. If in props value is true, then it means the element is moving from entering state to exiting state. If in props value is false, then it means the element is moving from exiting to exited.
