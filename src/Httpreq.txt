
When developing web applications - we routinelly access resources hosted on a server. Asking for, sending, or performing other operations on resources is accomplished through HTTP requests. These requests are sent from the client to a host on a server. When making HTTP request, the client employs a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and a payload that contains the necessary information to access the server resources.

The five commonplace HTTP request methods are GET, PUT, POST, PATCH, and DELETE.


What is GET Request?
GET is an HTTP request method that is used to obtain resources from servers.

Axios and the Fetch API are the two main methods for making HTTP requests.

The Fetch API is a built-in promise-based JavaScript module for retrieving resources from a server or an API endpoint.
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client library that makes it simple to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints. This is an external library that must be installed.
